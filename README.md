## üìò What is AutoSetDNS?

**AutoSetDNS** is a lightweight tool that automatically configures your DNS settings based on the values defined in `AutoSetDNS.config.json`.

- `Install.exe` registers a scheduled task named **AutoSetDNS** in Windows Task Scheduler.
- This task monitors network connections and updates the DNS settings automatically to your preferred DNS servers.
- `Uninstall.exe` removes the scheduled task from your system.

> By default, it uses **Cloudflare DNS** (`1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`), but you can easily customize it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: False Positive Detected

Some antivirus engines like VirusTotal may flag the `AutoSetDNS.exe`, `Install.exe`, or `Uninstall.exe` files as potentially dangerous.  
These alerts are **false positives**.

These `.exe` files are compiled from **clean, transparent PowerShell source code** that has been reviewed and verified to:

- ‚úÖ Only perform local DNS configuration  
- ‚úÖ Never access the internet or modify sensitive system areas  
- ‚úÖ Use legitimate Windows Task Scheduler functionality  
- ‚úÖ Include no obfuscation, encryption, or malicious logic

Detections are likely triggered because the executables:
- Interact with system settings (like DNS)
- Register scheduled tasks (a behavior sometimes flagged by antivirus engines)

You can run the `.ps1` scripts directly or **compile them yourself** if preferred.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compile PowerShell Scripts to EXE (Optional)

### üì¶ Step 1: Install `ps2exe`

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name ps2exe -Scope CurrentUser
```

### üìÑ Step 2: Compile the Scripts

Navigate to the folder with your `.ps1` files and run:

```powershell
Invoke-PS2EXE .\AutoSetDNS.ps1 .\AutoSetDNS.exe
Invoke-PS2EXE .\Install.ps1 .\Install.exe
Invoke-PS2EXE .\Uninstall.ps1 .\Uninstall.exe
```

‚úÖ You now have clean, self-built `.exe` files from trusted source code.
